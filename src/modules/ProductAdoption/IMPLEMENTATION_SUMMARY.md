## Technical Debt & Improvements

1. **TypeScript Enhancements**
   - Add stricter typing for tour conditions
   - Create type guards for tour validation
   - Improve generic types for service responses

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implement React.memo for heavy components
   - Add virtualization for long tour lists
   - Optimize re-renders in preview mode

3. **Code Organization**
   - Create separate hooks for tour logic
   - Extract common utilities
   - Implement proper error handling strategy

## Next Steps Priority

1. **High Priority**
   - Complete tour renderer for end-user display
   - Implement basic analytics tracking
   - Add tour activation/deactivation logic
   - Create user-facing tour widget

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Build analytics dashboard
   - Add advanced targeting UI
   - Implement tour templates
   - Add import/export functionality

3. **Low Priority**
   - A/B testing features
   - Advanced widgets (tooltips, banners)
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Performance optimizations

## Dependencies & Requirements

- All current PrimeReact components are utilized
- Firebase integration exists but needs enhancement
- Rich text editing requires quill.js (via PrimeReact Editor)
- Drag-and-drop uses react-beautiful-dnd

## Notes for Next Session

- The tour service currently uses Firebase but has stub implementation for local storage
- Preview functionality is working but needs polish for production
- Element selector may need refinement for complex SPAs
- Consider implementing a tour marketplace for sharing templates
- Mobile experience needs specific attention
- Accessibility features should be prioritized for compliance
