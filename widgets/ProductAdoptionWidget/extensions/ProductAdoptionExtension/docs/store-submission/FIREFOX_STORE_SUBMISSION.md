   ```

### Update Mechanism

For self-distributed extensions:

   "browser_specific_settings": {
     "gecko": {
       "update_url": "https://productadoption.com/firefox/updates.json"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Host Update Manifest**
   ```json
   {
     "addons": {
       "tourextension@productadoption.com": {

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Validation Errors

**Error**: "Permission 'tabs' requires justification"
```
Justification: The 'tabs' permission is used to detect when users navigate between pages during multi-page tour creation. We only access tab URLs to maintain tour context, never browsing history.
```

**Error**: "Unsafe innerHTML usage detected"
```javascript
// Replace innerHTML with safe alternatives
element.textContent = userContent; // For text
element.appendChild(sanitizedNode); // For HTML
```

### 2. Performance Issues

**Problem**: Slow extension startup
```javascript
// Implement lazy loading
browser.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(async () => {
  // Only load essentials
  await loadCoreModules();
  
  // Defer non-critical initialization
  setTimeout(() => loadSecondaryModules(), 1000);
});
```

### 3. Compatibility Issues

**Problem**: API differences from Chrome
```javascript
// Use browser namespace instead of chrome
const storage = browser.storage || chrome.storage;

// Handle promise vs callback APIs
function getStorage(key) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    storage.local.get(key, (data) => {
      resolve(data[key]);
    });
  });
}
```

### 4. Content Security Policy

**Problem**: CSP violations
```javascript
// Avoid inline scripts
// Bad:
element.onclick = () => console.log('clicked');

// Good:
element.addEventListener('click', () => console.log('clicked'));
```

### 5. Memory Leaks

**Problem**: Extension uses too much memory
```javascript
// Clean up event listeners
class Component {
  constructor() {
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
    document.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick);
  }
  
  destroy() {
    document.removeEventListener('click', this.handleClick);
  }
}
```
