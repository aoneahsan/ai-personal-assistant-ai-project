      "browser_action_next_to_addressbar": true
    }
  }
}
```

# dist/productadoption-edge-1.0.0.zip
```

5. Select build directory
6. Test all functionality:
   - Installation flow

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Package Validation Errors

**Error**: "Invalid manifest version"
```json
// Ensure Manifest V3
{
  "manifest_version": 3,
  // ... rest of manifest
}
```

**Error**: "Missing required icons"
```json
{
  "icons": {
    "16": "icons/icon-16.png",
    "48": "icons/icon-48.png",
    "128": "icons/icon-128.png"
  }
}
```

### 2. Certification Failures

**Issue**: "Extension uses excessive permissions"

Solution: Provide detailed justification:
```
The 'tabs' permission is required to:
1. Detect page navigation during multi-page tour creation
2. Ensure tours work across user's navigation flow
3. We only access tab URLs, never browsing history
```

### 3. Performance Issues

**Issue**: "High memory usage detected"

Solution:
```javascript
// Implement cleanup
class ExtensionManager {
  cleanup() {
    // Remove event listeners
    this.removeListeners();
    
    // Clear caches
    this.clearCache();
    
    // Garbage collection hint
    if (global.gc) global.gc();
  }
}
```

### 4. Edge-Specific Compatibility

**Issue**: "Doesn't work with Edge features"

Solution:
```javascript
// Detect Edge and adjust
const isEdge = navigator.userAgent.includes('Edg/');

if (isEdge) {
  // Enable Edge-specific features
  enableEdgeOptimizations();
}
```

### 5. Store Listing Rejections

**Issue**: "Description doesn't match functionality"

Solution:
- Review and update description
- Ensure all claimed features work
- Remove any unsupported claims
- Add clarifications if needed
